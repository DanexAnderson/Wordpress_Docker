Docker Steps:
            
1) Within file directory run: docker-compose up -d
2) docker-compose down
3) docker container ls : shows running containers -a (all)

4) To fix permissions => /var/lib/docker/overlays2  = change file owner add rw
    search same for config.inc.php = change group access to read only
